INTRODUCTION

Mother Earth cannot be our home for long. The resources on Earth are dwindling day by day because the human population is increasing drastically. It is time for us to use the enormous potentials in space. So, we could begin by setting up a colony in space as the first step towards colonizing space.
SHARP: Space Habitation And Research Platform is a settlement designed as a colony for about 15,000 people. It incorporates advanced technologies including new methods of energy production (like fusion reactors), LSS (Life Support System), maglev and ion engine transport system etc. The settlement is protected from external factors like debris, meteors etc. using alloys of Titanium and Aluminium. Protection from heat and radiation is achieved using grid blasted Tungsten (which can withstand temperature of more than 30000C) and Carbon nanotube products (which absorb the radiation).
SHARP is designed to give its inhabitants a feel of life on Earth. Thus it would be apt in calling it                                 “A home away from home “.





























CHAPTER 1










POSITIONING OF THE SETTLEMENT


The best solution that we propose for placing the space settlement would be one of the Lagrange points (or Libration points), which are locations in space where gravitational forces and the orbital motion of a body balance each other. These points were discovered by the French mathematician Louis Lagrange in 1772.


Figure 1


Of the five Lagrange points, three are unstable and two are stable. The unstable Lagrange points, labeled L1, L2, and L3 lie along the line connecting the two large masses. An object at L1, L2 and L3 is meta-stable. A small impulse is enough to make it move away. If the space settlement would be situated in one of these points, it would frequently have to use its small rocket firings to remain in the area, process in which part of the fuel and stored energy will be lost.

The L4 and L5 points are stable orbits so long as the mass ratio between the two large masses exceeds 0.0385 (M1/M2 < 0.0385). The condition is satisfied not just for the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon systems, but for many other pairs of bodies in the Solar system.

The points L1, L2, L3 lie on the same straight line (they are collinear) and the points L4, L5 lie on the vertices of two equilateral triangles.

Another reason why we should consider the L4 or L5 points as the most suitable for placing a space settlement is that the Sun’s pull makes any object in Earth-Moon L4 and L5 locations “orbit” the Lagrange points in 89 days, which demonstrates the high stability of these areas. We must also consider the L4 and L5 points’ proximity to the Moon which represents a great advantage because the settlement will be able to exploit the raw materials of the moon. Despite their stability, the L4 and L5 points of the Earth-Mars system are not a considerable solution because of the large, inefficient distance which separates them from a constant source of raw materials.

Due to the edifying facts above, we come to the conclusion that the space settlement should be placed in the L4 or L5 points of the Earth-Moon system. So we decided to place the settlement on the L4 point since it will be the first to receive the sunlight during the revolution around the earth also can gain gravity assist from the two large masses when the system is made to sync with them. The simple and a logical fact prove that the two points are the only most suitable positions where the settlement could be placed.



Structure and Dimensions

SHARP is designed based on a toroidal shape, with a sphere on the centre. The two large solar arrays are used as one of the power sources for the settlement.
The reason for this shape:

When we made a design study, we found the following results from different shapes. Which are as follows?
The Cylinder:

> This option offers interesting features. It is expandable (one can elongate the cylinder and enlarge the living space), it sustains 1g everywhere with no variations in gravity levels, it is relatively easy to build (combination of rings layered next to each other to form a cylindrical shape), presents a strong and sturdy structure. If some of its surface is covered with glass, it lets in sufficient amounts of natural light. But compared to the Torus, it demands a larger atmospheric volume. Therefore, although the cylinder is a very good option, it is not the optimal one.


The Sphere:
It is a very attractive option since it emulates the shape of our Earth, but we would live within it rather than on its outer surface. Our Sun would be at its core, we would have a wonderful feeling of openness and space. The sphere’s outer surface would be covered with solar panels to collect a significant amount of energy for consumption by the station. This option was proposed by Dr. Freeman Dyson and studied at length by others. Although it provides an enormous volume, a surface area and gathers vast amounts of energy, it is not optimal. By using pseudo-gravity by means of rotation, 1g would only be obtained at the sphere’s equator. Therefore, despite its enormous volume, the sphere’s livable area could be relatively small. Also, its enormous mass would require huge amounts of materials, with serious cost implications, transport difficulties. Altogether, this option is too risky for both financial and logistical reasons and is not an optimal solution for a first attempt to build a human colony in space.




The Dumbbell:
> This option offers a livable area that is comparable to that of the Sphere, while using far less volume. It is certainly an improvement over the Sphere, though it brings with it some disadvantages: It is not expandable, and transport between the two mini-spheres is rather difficult (people stand in opposite directions in each of the mini-spheres, i.e., they stand on an East-West axis on one and on the West-East axis on the other).

The Torus:
> Most research shows that the Torus is the most efficient shape for this type of station. As the numbers in the above comparative table show, the Torus provides the best livable area compared to its size. It lets in sufficient amounts of sunlight, provides a relatively open vista for its inhabitants, it could be built with modular structures and assembled in space. It is also expandable in the sense that several toruses may be stacked to create extra space for the population, with light flowing through its center.

SHARP will have a composite shape containing both a torus and a sphere in the middle.

The torus will house the habitat of the colonists, while sphere in the middle will house docking facilities, industries, and research.


Recognizing that the torus presents the most attractive characteristics, we tried to investigate the torus further, in order to determine whether any variation of the torus could offer an even more optimal structure for SHARP.  We therefore examined three other shapes, based on the toroidal structure. Our aim was to improve on the characteristics of the torus by looking for the optimal combination of habitable area (i.e., more living space) and relatively less atmospheric volume.
I considered a toroidal ellipsoidal model which will meet most of the above constraints. The advantages of this model are that it is capable of housing more than 18,288 people.
> The average liveable area is around 30000m3 per person which is calculated using the formula

Where V is the volume of the residential area, r stands for the smaller radius of the torus and the R stands for the larger radius of the torus.
The total diameter of the toroid is 12000m and the internal diameter is around 2000m.The diameter of the sphere is 4000m. The cylindrical tunnel is of 500m diameter, which is made of nano polymer mixed metal which makes it to contract and expand like a piston. This new feature makes the settlement to evolve in time based on the increase in population.
The size of the solar arrays will be 500\*200m each.


Gravity

Colonizing, mining, manufacturing and other activities in space will require a large workforce in space.  The provision of an artificial gravity recuperation habitat for these space employees will be an essential part of an employer’s responsibility to its employees in the colonization of Earth orbit and beyond.  Space business, to be profitable, must have manned space stations to take advantage of extraterrestrial space resources such as Near Earth Asteroids (NEA), and destinations of great distance, such as Mars.
Settlement rotation will provide artificial gravity.  The settlement consists of a toroid shape, where the toroid is symmetrically attached by cylindrical columns to and rotating about a central hub. Artificial gravity within the settlement results from rotation about the central hub. Cylindrical tubes attach the toroid to the central hub.
We need 1g of gravity to sustain a normal life on the settlement, so the settlement is made to rotate about its own central axis. Since the settlement has a diameter of about 11000m the settlement must be made to rotate at       which is derived from the formula
V2= r g where v stand for the velocity with which the object should rotate, r stands for the radius of the settlement which is 6000m and g stands for gravitational force which is 9.8m/s2 on earth.
To produce this RPM we use nano propulsion as thrusters to maintain the RPM. The basic principle behind this gravity concept is the centripetal and centrifugal force.
For a settlement in orbit around a planet or an object in space, the centripetal force is supplied by the gravitational attraction between the settlement and the planet, and acts toward the centre of mass of the two objects. For an object at the end of a rope rotating about a vertical axis, the centripetal force is the horizontal component of the tension of the rope, which acts towards the centre of mass between the axis of rotation and the rotating object. For a settlement, internal tensile stress is the centripetal force that holds the object together in one piece.
The rate of change of the object's velocity vector is the centripetal acceleration.
The centripetal acceleration varies with the radius r of the settlement and speed v of the object, becoming larger for greater speed and smaller radius. More precisely, the centripetal acceleration is given by

Where ω = v / r is the magnitude of angular velocity. The negative sign indicates that the direction of this acceleration is towards the centre of the settlement, i.e., opposite to the position vector r. (We assume that the origin of r is the centre of the settlement.)
SHARP also gets gravity assist form the two large masses when it is made to sync with earth and moon.















CHAPTER 2












Construction

Since SHARP has to hold a large number of people and provide earthly conditions, the settlement must be strong enough to withstand the constraints that it faces. The structure must be very strong and should be capable of withstanding any impacts to the settlement. The settlement is also capable of shrinking towards the centre, thus creating room for more people in the long time aspect. The outer surface remains immovable while the inner ring surface is expandable.
The material that is identified as the most feasible one is the alloy of titanium and aluminum. The characteristic of this material is such that it has a very large melting point and also it is very strong. This alloy has a very high tensile strength, so it is capable of withstanding a big impact. The parts required for construction comes from both the moon and earth. Basically the construction site is made on the L1 of the liberation points. Since it is near to the moon and parts can be easily transported to the site. Once the construction is complete it is transferred to the L4.
Resources
As we look at the lunar soil composition, it has almost all the essential life supporting materials. So we use only one source for the construction of the settlement that is the lunar regolith. From the lunar regolith we are going to extract almost all essential substances such as, materials for construction, oxygen, nitrogen, fuel for the fusion reactor, soil for the plants to grow, water production etc.
We also make use of the space debris and the waste scrap from earth to construct this settlement. The waste scraps from the settlement is taken from the earth where it is pre processed and can be used directly, the major applications of this scrap would be in the form of metal composites that will be used for the external construction of the settlement. Since it is cost effective and also provides a solution for waste removal.



If we take a look at the composition of the moon, we can find out that about 42% of the soil is made up of oxygen. So we extract this oxygen by treating with FeTiO3 otherwise known as ileminite.
The next largest is iron which is mined and processed through blast furnace. Though iron is abundant it is very heavy so it is not required for the construction, though it is used for construction of the habitats. The amount of aluminum is 13%. This metal is extracted and processed with titanium to produce a very strong alloy material that is used for the settlement construction.
Material properties
Titanium
The most important material for the construction of the space settlement will be the Titanium
Oxide. For the construction of the torus, the 0 gravity center and the annexes we will use an amount of 88980425100 kg of TiO2. In the table below we will enumerate some of the Titanium Oxide properties. We will also use silicium, aluminium, lead and other metals for the functional completeness of the Space Settlement.

Aluminium
Pure aluminium is a silvery-white metal with many useful characteristics. Alloys with small amounts of copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese, and other elements have very useful properties. Strength on pure aluminium has a tensile strength of between 49 MPa and 700 MPa depending of alloying type and the heat treatment. Aluminium is a very good conductor of electricity, also being non-magnetic and non-combustible. it helps building large structures rotating for creating artificial gravity.

It can also be used as material for building mirrors, because aluminium mirrors are good reflectors, being able to compete even with those made out of asteroidal nickel. Atomized aluminium can also be used as a good fuel, when burned in oxygen


































Moons resources fig:





Extraction of minerals:
One of the methods used here is by magnetic separation for minerals which has magnetic properties. Another way of extracting is that the use of electrostatic separation techniques which is explained as follows.
The first step in this type of separation is the separation of material pieces of the same size. This separation can be done by sieving by screens, and consequently passed through grinders, and sieved for a second time, in order to achieve uniformity.

The second step is using static electricity, charging the mineral grains and separating them by passing them through an electric field. This separation method is using the principle that different minerals have different electrostatic affinities, more exactly each mineral absorbs a different quantity of charge, depending on structure and composition. The material must pass this process for a few times, for obtaining a better separation of the minerals. This process doesn’t alter the mineral in any way. It offers only separation.

The electrical charge can be made in several methods:

• Charging the sieving screen
• Charging any surface that they come in contact to
• Using an electron beam as they fall.
This choice must be made depending on what type on mineral we wish to separate, each mineral having a different response to different methods and working conditions.
The separated material is put aside in special compartments. It is called the “concentrate”, and the output is called “tailing”.



Fig: separation process


This type of separation is used in obtaining the separation of not only one mineral. We can use more than one compartment, and the streaming material will split in multiple streams, depending on the charge they possess and the type on interaction with the magnetic field.

Space vacuum increases the speed and rate of this process, lacking wind, and giving the possibility of creating stronger energetic fields (10 times stronger) than in Earth’s Atmosphere. Also the lack of moisture is a factor that speeds up this process. Water makes the grains stick together, and also changes the minerals’ electrical properties (conductivity), reducing differences between minerals (This process on Earth is preceded by roasting the mineral probe). The low gravity on the Moon (1/6 of Earth’s gravity) also helps the separation process by decreasing the speed of the separated grains’ fall and as such, increasing the speed of the separation.

For the Solar Power Satellite (SPS), the General Dynamics report states: “The presence of large quantities of fine glass particles in lunar regolith is particularly relevant to the recommended use of foamed glass as primary structure for the SPS solar array and antennas. Foamed glass is commercially manufactured from fine particles of ground glass by the addition of small quantities of foaming agents and the application of heat. Thus, beneficiation of lunar regolith to recover the large amounts of fine glass particles may permit the direct production of all of the foamed glass needed for the SPS with few or no intermediate steps required to prepare the glass for foaming.” This method can also be applied building the space settlement.

> Glass production:
The transparent material that we use must be very strong and capable of maintaining the internal atmosphere. It must also be radiation proof. After a thorough study we decided to use foamed glass which is considered to have the most mechanical properties that makes its possibility to be used in space.
Since glass produced on earth is heavily contaminated by water vapor in the atmosphere, this contributing to the low mechanical proprieties (britteling material, weak, and non resistant to shocks). This fact has lead to research concerning “anhydrous glass”, manufactured in the absence of water and which can be used in structures.

The raw material used for producing this material is taken from the moon, as the material FeO is available in abundance on the moon. The glass is made colorless by adding traces of SiO2. To make this radiation proof we use carbon nanotubes, which can effectively filter the small photons that are found in the solar flares. And lead Pb+ is used to filter any type of radiation from space.















CHAPTER 3










Life Support Systems
This deals with the essentials required for a human being to live. The following table shows the basic requirements for a human to live in space keeping in mind about all the other factors.

Fig: Overall quantifiable requirements for sharp

Based on the above requirements, the following methods are implemented to satisfy the needs of every person.
Food production
The basic requirements for the food production are soil, water, sunlight, etc.  The soil must contain highly nutritious minerals such as nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and other mineral salts for effective plant growth. Keeping these factors in mind SHARP goes for the usage of lunar regolith which is highly rich in minerals and salts for the plants to grow in. The following explains about the recycling the lunar soil for effective plant growth.
One of the core biotechnologies functions is the use of hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting bacterial ecology. These thermophilic bacteria can play an important role in increasing the effectiveness of the processing of human metabolic waste and inedible biomass and of converting them to fertilizer for the cultivation of plants. One of the characteristics of the technology is that the metabolic heat release that occurs during bacterial fermentation raises the processing temperature sufficiently high at 80–100 °C to support hyper-thermophilic bacteria. Such a hyper-thermophilic system is found to have great capability of decomposing wastes including even their normally recalcitrant components, in a reasonably short period of time and of providing a better quality of fertilizer as an end-product. High quality compost has been shown to be a key element in creating a healthy regenerative food production system. In ground-based studies, the soil microbial ecology after the addition of high quality compost was shown to improve plant growth and promote a healthy symbiosis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Another advantage of such high processing temperature is the ability to sterilize the pathogenic organisms through the fermentation process and thus to secure the hygienic safety of the system. Plant cultivation is one of the other major systems. The combination of hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting, plant cultivation, and tree growing with utilizing in-situ natural local resources creates an agricultural able land.
Another way of agriculture:
Growing crops in space is a challenging one. The New and the most interesting concept which will be used in SHARP is the growth of plants in a liquid medium. Here we place the seeds in a wired mesh (WM), and this wired mesh is placed in the shallow depth of the nutrient liquid.
Production of water
Since water and oxygen are the most basic requirements of the every human being for their metabolic activities, so it is estimated that about 20 kg/man-day volume of water is required for each person. In order to meet this challenge SHARP uses the following ways to produce water.
> Water is being produced by fuel cells where the H2 and O2 are produced from the lunar regolith as it contains these substances in plenty and also from the byproduct of CO2 scrubbing, co2 reduction.
The byproduct of this reaction is electricity which is stored and utilized along with domestic power production.
The reaction is as follows
H2   + O2 → 2H2O
The hydrogen and oxygen is used here are fed into the two electrolytic cells and then current is passed initially it initiate the reaction. The H2 atom combines with the O2 atoms. And the electrons from the electric discharge are used for the bonding of theses atoms to form water. However this water is not suitable for domestic use, so we process this by mixing with all the essential minerals and salt in their right proportions that makes it possible for drinking.
The waste water from the settlement is filtered and recycled by passing through carbon nanotubes that filter the solid particles in the waste water and then it is fed to the chlorine contact tank where it is cleared form bacteria and other microorganisms. Thus the water is recycled for drinking and other domestic use.

Atmosphere

Production of oxygen
No man can live without oxygen, so SHARP utilizes the following method for oxygen production
Oxygen can be produced using STATIC FEED electrolysis where it goes on circulating the whole system this electrolysis is done using waste treated water so that there is no disposal of waste water.

This is the chemical reaction that takes place in the electrolysis.
THE oxygen is also produced using lunar material called limonite.
The processes considered here are based on the reduction of ilmenite at high temperature. Ilmenite (FeTiO3) is a common mineral in the lunar soil, and is the most likely source of lunar oxygen [& all](Allen.md). Other potential feedstocks are volcanic glass and basalt. The ilmenite can be reduced either by hydrogen [& all](Gibson.md)
> The respective reactions are:
FeTiO3 + H2 ---> Fe + TiO2 + H2O
H2O ---> H2 + 1/2 O2
It is produced by the following method
1.	The sample is put in a vessel heated up to 1000 C, under a flow of H2, then a reaction occurs :
FeTiO3 + H2 ---> Fe + TiO2 + H2O
In the Williams' experiment, the vessel was a 2 cm\*11 cm stainless steel cylinder electrically heated, which lead to 1475 W of electrical power. Of course, it will be far more interesting to use directly the solar energy. With a solar flux of 1358 W/m2, however, a direct heating is not possible:  the temperature of a material with solar absorptive a and infrared emissivity e is given by:

T^4=G\*a/e\*s [Larson](Larson.md)

Where G is the solar flux and s is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
5.67\*10-8W.m-2.K-4
For T = 1300 K, G required is 10 to 40 times the one available on the Moon. The upper value gives us, for a cylindrical mirror, a focal length of 1 m for a width of 20 cm [Wieder](Wieder.md).
The output of this mechanism contains both H2 and H2O: water is collected and electrolyzed, providing there is enough power available. Cooler is used to condense the water, a drier to absorb it produced and measure the quantity, then electrolyzed it.
> Stock the water vapour produced by the reaction in a tank, and then measures the quantity.  It works with vapour a 1000 C, which is the exhaust temperature from the vessel, and requires half less power than liquid phase electrolysis.

Production of Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most basic requirement for the life support system, since it is used for producing other products like water, power, etc.
Hydrogen production through solar energy water electrolysis, as this system makes use of the excess water vapour in the environment. The system also makes use of waste water and the radiation from the sun for effective electrolysis.
The following method is implemented is implemented for the production of hydrogen.
The electrochemical process is shown in the fig.



> A tight solid oxide electrolyte wall (OES) is covered with two electronic drivers respectively providing the function of anode and cathode. This wall separates two atmospheres in circulation containing a mixture H2–H2O, on the one hand, and pure oxygen, on the other. Under the applied tension U, the water vapour molecules are dissociated with cathode in O2– ions and hydrogen according to the reaction:
2

The O2– ions migrate through the wall of OES. With the anode, following the oxidation of theO2– ions, oxygen is released according to the reaction:
2

The total reaction of this decomposition is written as follows:

The mass m (kg) of hydrogen gas produced with cathode (in the ideal case) is proportional to the quantity of current having crossed the cell and to the atomic mass M of hydrogen and inversely proportional to valence n of this one:

The mass m (kg) of hydrogen gas produced with cathode (in the ideal case) is proportional to the quantity of current having crossed the cell and to the atomic mass M of hydrogen and inversely proportional to valence n of this one:

Where t is the time in s. The value of the real production being lower than that given in the ideal case, the relationship between the real and ideal production is called output of current or faradic output f, which depends exclusively on the importance of the secondary or parasitic reactions and not of overpressures. The expression of the produced hydrogen mass m becomes then:

In terms of flow, this last expression is written:


While posing:


For given hydrogen flow, the current intensity necessary to its production becomes:

From the characteristics abacus of the electrolyser, one can determine the density of current J (A/cm²) which corresponds to the neutral tension thermo. Thus the electrode surface AE will be calculated by:

The total energy of electrolysis W (W) is expressed according to the real tension U (V) and  of intensity I (A) by the expression:

The power necessary for the electrolysis of water is given by the relation [8](8.md):

By introducing the expression of I from Eq. (16) into the last Eq. (19), the expression of the power W becomes:

If the electrolysis cells are fed by a vapour flow in Kg/h, the quantity of produced hydrogen, in accordance with Eq. (12), is:

The necessary power (W) for the electrolysis of a water vapour flow  is thus:




Maintaining the cycle:
The cycle of all the gases should be maintained in order to lead a sustained life on the settlement, all the life sustaining gases that are produced are released into the atmosphere of the settlement. The waste gases are filtered for regeneration. All these process takes place simultaneously. The waste gas and the pure gases are produced in the central hub of the system. The basic atmospheric cycle looks like this



Power system

> Power is the basic requirement for all the systems in the settlement to work. We need many mega watts of electricity for all the process to work. So SHARP uses the state of the art new technology for the power production. The following are the methods that are implemented for power in SHARP
MTF-Magnetized Target Fusion[18](18.md)

"MTF tries to operate in an intermediate regime between the conventional magnetic fusion, and inertial confinement using a laser,
Inertial confinement fusion uses tiny plasma, 1,000 trillion times denser than in a magnetic confinement scheme. But that requires a driver - usually banks of intense, short-pulse lasers - that heat and compress the target in a short time.
MTF tries to operate at not too low or too high a density, and achieve a reasonable rate of fusion activity with a density 10,000 to 100,000 times higher than magnetic confinement, and 10,000 to 100,000 times lower than laser fusion.
It's more economical and uses pulse-power drivers - powerful capacitor banks that drive electromagnetic implosion - that are available today at low cost. It does not have the implosion speed generated a laser beam, but a magnetic field confines the target plasma and insulates the inertial wall that implodes to cause the fusion.
A rotating magnetic field could induce a magnetic field and electrical currents, "a clever way of fooling the plasma" into behaving as if it was in a conventional magnetic mirror system.
In turn, the mass of the spacecraft would come down from 720 to 230 tonnes, and the 44-meter (144-ft) long engine would have a specific impulse of 130,000 seconds.
You can use the power [would generate](it.md) to power electric propulsion, or use the plasma for thrust.




Fig: model of fusion reactor
> Fig: Harnessing Fusion energy for Power


Inertial Confinement
The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is experimenting with using laser beams to induce fusion. In the NIF device, 192 laser beams will focus on single point in a 10-meter-diameter target chamber called a hohlraum. A hohlraum is "a cavity whose walls are in radiative equilibrium with the radiant energy within the cavity" (Science & Engineering Encyclopedia).

Courtesy National Ignition Facility
Inertial-confinement fusion process
At the focal point inside the target chamber, there will be a pea-sized pellet of deuterium-tritium encased in a small, plastic cylinder. The power from the lasers (1.8 million joules) will heat the cylinder and generate X-rays. The heat and radiation will convert the pellet into plasma and compress it until fusion occurs. The fusion reaction will be short-lived, about one-millionth of a second, but will yield 50 to 100 times more energy than is needed to initiate the fusion reaction. A reactor of this type would have multiple targets that would be ignited in succession to generate sustained heat production. Scientists estimate that each target can be made for as little as $0.25, making the fusion power plant cost efficient.

Fusion ignition process
The power generated is around 1000MW.
We also generate electricity during electrolysis of water in the fuel cells.
Solar arrays:[19](19.md)
We also make use of the solar energy to meet the needs of the settlement. Here we use a large array of solar cells which is of type Stretched lens array squarerigger (SLASR).
This SLASR is made up of nano materials which are used in the lens and the radiator elements.  This solar array is capable of producing 1MW (300–500W/kg specific power, 80–120 kW/m3 stowed power, and operational voltages above 1000V).
The following diagram explains the working of SLASR

> The size of this array is about 500\*200m and it automatically turns towards the sun. So that it gets constant radiation from the sun.

The principle behind this solar array is shown in the figure.


The model of this solar array looks like this
> The solar array automatically adjusts its position by mechanical systems, so that it is always facing the sun.


Waste regeneration

Usually, wastes are considered materials which are no longer useful and can therefore be disposed of. However, given the special nature of life in space and the need to recycle and re-use a maximum amount of materials, the solid and liquid wastes will be processed, along with human wastes (the recycling of gaseous wastes will be handled by the air system). This process will constitute SHARP’s waste management system.
The main objective of the waste management system is to process waste materials before they build up to toxic levels and to convert them into different kinds of useful inputs. The processes to be used could be physiochemical including techniques such as water reclamation technology for contaminated water, dehydration processes to obtain dry waste (as used in the Skylab and Space Shuttle programs), oxidation methods which either combine solid and liquid waste oxidation or convert solid waste into sterile ash. There are also regeneration techniques which use microorganisms either by themselves or in combination (generally aquatic animals).
In deciding on our waste management concept, there are a few important elements to retain:
• The waste management method should efficiently convert the various wastes into useful inputs for other elements of the station, i.e., we should maximize the efficiency of the system by selectively recovering what can be recovered for re-use on the settlement; and
• We should pay close attention to the trace elements that remain. Despite the decades of scientific research on water quality, it has been difficult to reduce the risk of traces of remaining contaminants to zero. There is a danger that such trace elements may become concentrated to toxic levels. It is therefore important not only to establish levels of tolerability and toxicity for all living components on the station, but also to put in place very stringent methods for monitoring and controlling all phases of waste collection and treatment on the station.
One of the methods used to control organic waste is by decaying them using the bacteria’s that survive on space conditions. All the decaying is done in a closed container to ensure safety of the system. The output of the decaying is the biogas which is used for the production of the oxygen, nitrogen and water.
And the inorganic waste is thoroughly recycled and the leftovers are dumped on any of the asteroids which do not cause any harm to the system or any planet.

> Protection

Radiation protection:
Space consist of cosmic rays which are very harmful for the human beings, we have to protect the settlement from these radiations. The following methods are followed.
The part other than the glass in the settlement is coated with multi layered grit blasted tungsten and carbon nanotubes. Since this tungsten is capable of withstanding very high temperatures (above 5000 C). This method protects the system from solar flares, which are considered as the most dangerous of all radiations as it contains positively charged particles.
The other method implemented is the electromagnetic shielding. This provides both protection as well as self defense mechanism. The technology involved here is the magnetic shield which based on the fact that a charged particle’s trajectory in a magnetic field is curved. When the particle enters the region of high magnetic field, its trajectory will be curved away from the region we want to protect from radiation. For example, let’s consider the Alpha particles ( 4α2 ) as radiating factor. They represent 8% of the maximum amount of ionizing particles found in space. Their mass (m1) is 4μ, their speed (v) is of approximately 1000 Km/s and their electric charge (q) is 2e. The figure below shows the particle’s change of trajectory when entering a magnetic field zone.


We notice that in all cases the trajectory of the particle is tangent to the magnetic field zone in point P. This can also be shown using a geometrical demonstration, based on the drawing below:

Knowing the electromagnetic induction of the field (B), the mass (m ), the speed ( v􀁇 ) and the
charge (q) of the Alpha particle, we can determine the Lawrence force ( f) and the radius of
the particle’s circular trajectory ( R ).


Let’s assume that R=[R0](https://code.google.com/p/sharp/source/detail?r=0) (the radius of the magnetic field). For generating and maintaining a certain magnetic field around the torus we will use a series of close wound bobbins placed on the exterior margins of the torus, powered by photovoltaic panels. The distance between coils can be calculated by taking into account the electromagnetic induction we wish to generate.
We can determine the inductance of a single-layer coil according to the Wheeler formula, which
States:


We can also find the amperage needed to maximize the efficiency of the electromagnetic field.





Taking into account that the coils will be entirely exposed to the ionizing radiations, we have
chosen the radius of a coil ([R0](https://code.google.com/p/sharp/source/detail?r=0)) to be half of its length (l).


The determined amperage is very low and thus it is very easy to generate. The electromagnetic
field created by the system of coils will be functioning at satisfactory efficiency and will protect the torus from ionizing radiations. For obtaining a more intense electromagnetic induction using the same amperage and without having to increase the length of the coil systems we could use multi-layered coils, which consist in a number of concentric common coils. We will be able to generate a more intense electromagnetic field with almost the same use of energy.
Still there will be points found in less intense electromagnetic field somewhere between the coils, but they will not raise any problem because of their symmetric repartition.



Thermal management
The waste heat produced due to the increase of green house gasses such as co2 emission should be controlled; else it would prove fatal to the system and the people. In order to maintain its stability SHARP uses the following methods,
It is pointed out that in a vacuum environment, convection is no longer available and the only mechanism of rejecting heat is radiation. Radiation follows the Stefan-Boltzmann Law
E= T4
where
E=the energy rejected  , the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
= 5.67 W m-2 K-4
T = the temperature at which the heat is radiated
That is, the total amount of heat radiated is proportional to the surface area of the radiator

These heat rejection systems may be broadly classified as passive or active, armored or unarmored. Each is expected to play a role in future space systems, Heat pipes: The first of these, called the "heat pipe," is conventionally considered the base system against which all others are judged. It has the significant advantage of being completely passive, with no moving parts, which makes it exceptionally suitable for use in the space environment. For the convenience of the reader, I will briefly describe the operational mechanism of the basic heat pipe. The heat pipe is a thin, hollow tube filled with a fluid specific to the temperature range at which it is to operate. At the hot end, the fluid is in the vapor phase and attempts to fill the tube, passing through the tube toward the cold end, where it gradually condenses into the liquid phase. The walls of the tube, or appropriate channels grooved into the tube, are filled with a wick-like material which returns the fluid by surface tension to the hot end, where it is re-vaporized and re-circulated.
Essentially the system is a small vapor cycle which uses the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends of the tube as a pump to transport heat, taking full advantage of the heat of vaporization of the particular fluid.
The fluid must be carefully selected to match the temperature range of operation. For example, at very high temperatures a metallic substance with a relatively high vaporization temperature, such as sodium or potassium, may be used. However, this choice puts a constraint on the low temperature end since, if the fluid freezes into a solid at the low temperature end, operation would cease until the relatively inefficient conduction of heat along the walls could melt it. At low temperatures a fluid with a low vaporization temperature, such as ammonia, might well be used, with similar constraints. The temperature may not be as high as to dissociate the ammonia at the hot end or so low as to freeze the ammonia at the cold end.
With proper design, heat pipes are an appropriate and convenient tool for thermal management in space systems. For example, at modest temperatures, the heat pipe could be made of aluminum, because of its relatively low density and high strength. Fins could be added to the heat pipe to increase its heat dissipation area. The aluminum, in order to be useful, must be thin enough to reduce the mass carried into space yet thick enough to offer reasonable resistance to meteoroid strikes.
A very carefully designed solid surface radiator made out of aluminum has the following capabilities in principle: The mass is approximately 5 kg/m2 with an emissivity of 0.86; the usable temperature range is limited by the softening point of aluminum (about 700 K). At higher temperatures, where refractory metals are needed, it would be necessary to multiply the mass of the radiator per square meter by at least a factor of 3. Nevertheless, from 700 K up to perhaps 900 K, the heat pipe radiator is still a very efficient method of rejecting heat.
A further advantage is that each heat pipe unit is a self-contained machine. Thus, the puncture of one unit does not constitute a single-point failure that would affect the performance of the whole system. Failures tend to be slow and graceful, provided sufficient redundancy.
Pump loop system: The pump loop system has many of the same advantages and is bounded by many of the same limitations associated with the heat pipe radiator. Here heat is collected through a system of fluid loops and pumped into a radiator system similar to conventional radiators used on Earth. It should be pointed out that in the Earth environment the radiator actually radiates very little heat; it is designed to convect its heat. The best known examples of the pump loop system currently used in space are the heat rejection radiators used in the Shuttle. These are the inner structure of the clamshell doors which are deployed when the doors are opened.
Pump loop systems have a unique advantage in that the thermal control system can easily be integrated into a spacecraft or space factory. The heat is picked up by conventional heat exchangers within the spacecraft, the carrier fluid is pumped through a complex system of pipes (extended by fins when deemed effective), and finally the carrier is returned in liquid phase through the spacecraft. In the case of the Shuttle, where the missions are short, additional thermal control is obtained by deliberately dumping fluid.
> CO2 Removal:

The CO2 levels in the atmosphere must be controlled, as it adds up to the heat in the atmosphere and also it would prove fatal if it goes above the critical limit. So, to control this we use scrubbing mechanism to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to control the toxic levels of the system.
The CO2 mixed air is sent through ion exchange nano resins where the CO2 is extracted from the air. The ion exchange has a nano resins through which the air is passed. When a current is passed through the ion exchange the CO2 gets entangled through the resins and the clean air comes out. The CO2 is removed from the nano resins by passing humid air which is then purified by treating it with LiOH.
The byproduct of this reaction is water that can be processed and used for drinking purpose. The reaction involved in this is as follows.
2 LiOH(s) + 2 H2O (g) → 2 LiOH.H2O(s)
2 LiOH.H2O(s) + CO2 (g) → Li2CO3(s) + 3 H2O (g)
The net reaction being:
2 LiOH(s) + CO2 (g) → Li2CO3 (s) + H2O (g)

Emergency management

In case of an emergency such as a fire, power failure etc. the backup generators situated in every habitat is automatically started and it can last for a month. Automatic recovery system will be activated and the software analyses the cause and it is restored.
> In case of fire, the system is equipped with the modern fire fighting system where the sensors detect the type and cause of the fire. Based on the type of fire, the extinguishers are used to fight automatically. These extinguishers are made up of pumps where they pump the material to the desired location through piping system. In case of a normal fire then domestic waste water from the under the surface is pumped to the spot, as this pipe runs almost all round the system. Therefore it is easier for the system to fight the fire. These pimping house is kept at every block and at every public places.
> In case of a meteor impact or a major devastation, an escape pod for every 30 people is situated in every habitat and in public places in which people can escape. These pods are pre programmed and destined to go to earth.




















CHAPTER 4









Accommodation

Weather system:
Temperature 22\*C is maintained artificially by heating or cooling systems of the air and water within the
ventilation system.

Although on Earth a large variety of interconnected climates which are found in large areas, each with different characteristics, we will not try “to copy” that on our space station because it is not efficient: first of all materials can wear out because of often changes; the limited space forces the agriculture and industry to be very high-tech but at the same time limited, because of that the production must be at a maximum; humans require comfort, safety in the everyday life, especially on a space station, that’s why optimal life conditions are necessary. Because of this reason the temperature in the inhabited spaces will be kept at 22\*C and in the other places of the station the temperature will differ in relation with the activities in those areas, although we will try to keep the differences minimal so that the average temperature will be constant.

Wind will be an important component on this station, as long as the ventilation system is very well thought. But in the special cases like parks and gardens where the wind has the purpose to reproduce the conditions of Earth, wind can be produce through processes like pressure differences and/or temperature between different bodies of air, or utilizing systems which “blow” wind with a controlled speed.

Rain will be created artificially in different ways: in agricultural areas there will be installed irrigation systems localized very high from the surface, so the falling water can imitate rain. Controlled through a well thought system this type of rain will assure the optimum humidity for the growing of crops and plants. In the gardens specially designed to imitate the conditions on Earth so the inhabitants will not miss Earth, or for them how Earth is like, clouds will be formed by evaporating a quantity of water and then through the process of condensation . These gardens will be very limited, being living museums
of an Earth-like environment. Another type of rain will be used in any inhabited or accessible (by a human) area on the ship. This type of rain(snow, or other types of precipitation) will be created virtually by using a screen that will mimic the sky, sunsets, sunrises and beautiful landscapes meant to delight the human eye.

> Illumination

NASA standards advise that “bright and uniform” wide-spectrum light should be employed in work areas. At night we must use warm white light; this would also serve in helping the average human’s association of “warm” light with pleasant activities. Natural lighting via the windows could serve the purpose of wide spectrum light. The house windows are important for orienting the colonists to their external environments. We must also take special care not creating large light contrasts which will affect the colonist’s sight. Automatic mirrors are auto programmed for 14-hour days and 10-hour nights. For increasing the photosynthesis rate and efficiently using electric power, fluorescent tubes situated under the habitable area will generate artificial red light, most of it being used in the raising of crops. We can also use light-emitting devices (LEDs) which can be obtained with the use of polymerization. This type of structured polymer can produce light patterns with sizes as small 0.8 ìm.
A film of a precursor to p-phenilen vinylene(PPV) is micromolded (in a solvent), in order to make variations in the thickness of the created film, and as such, to copy the relief on the mold. The thermal shaping of this precursor created a PPv with the same surface topography. The light emitting devices created in this process emit light preponderantly in the thin parts of the film. These types of devices can also be used in near field optics (being able to lead to new subwave length light sources).

The duration of days and nights in the agricultural areas will accord to the different plant metabolisms, so that growth and production will reach optimum efficiency; the plants will experience longer periods of light to intensify growth and maintaining their health.

Layout

The settlement is designed to accommodate up to 8000 people. The habitats are accommodated in a 5 storey flats system of up to 4 in a house. And independent houses over the agricultural area that can accommodate up to 6 people.
All the basic commodities are made available in the departmental stores situated one for every 10 flats and one for every 20 independent houses.
The habitats are built in a regular arranged fashion. And trees are planted over the road side. Mini forests are created as they would help oxygen production.
Artificial mountains and falls are created using recycled water. Railways are situated in the end of the settlement and in the centre. Roadways are under the living surface in order to save space. Elevators are situated in the roadways to come up to the living area.
> The solar panels are situated on both the sides of the settlement. That provides the basic power source for many of the production applications such as water for electrolysis.

Solar arrays
The industrial complex is situated in the central hub where it is a 0 gravity zone. People can go to the industrial complex through high speed magnetic elevator systems that connect the central hub to the toroid.  A communication antenna is positioned below the industrial complex.
The following figure shows the views of the tunnel

Outer view

Inside view

A communication antenna is positioned below the industrial complex.

Communication antenna

The system has emergency latches where people can escape using the escape pods. They are provided below the surface.
> Escape latch

Entertainment and Recreation

People get unlimited access to the internet so that they are in touch with the people on earth.  People can view TV and listen to music over the internet. A playground is constructed for every flat. There will also be three stadiums for big games to be held.

Health care and Hygiene

We propose to bring the doctor to the patient rather than take the patient to the doctor. So according to our plan there will be at least one doctor in every apartment. And depending on the size of the apartment the number of doctors will also increase with a limit set on the maximum number. If the situation is a emergency then the inner rail road’s are utilized and the patient is taken one of the four health care hospitals, one for each quadrant.
The whole settlement will be well maintained for its cleanliness and hygiene. Sensors and cameras will be positioned at almost all the public places. If there is any change in particular place robots will be deployed to maintain. The people in the settlement are advised not to ruin the pace and make it litter free.
All the food products will be will be sold on cans and the carry bags are replaced with tin foil covers since they are recyclable. These tin foils are produced using the waste scrap materials from earth and space debris.
Communication system

It will consist of one large 70m dishes which will be placed below the central hub of structure as shown.

The new antenna design option includes state-of-the-art technology for gain recovery through gravity compensation and precision pointing at frequencies up to 50 GHz. This frequency range is sufficient to support the future Ka-band communication requirements. The primary configuration is for Ka-band (32 GHz) downlink and X-band downlink and uplink operations, with allowance for future expansion to include Ka-band uplink. In addition, this antenna design would accommodate the existing 70-m antenna RF equipment, to the maximum extent possible, should the existing 70-m antennas become inoperable.

Key features of the new design are

• A 70-m-diameter main reflector
• Dual-shaped RF optics
• A center-fed BWG
• Feeds and front-end electronics located in alidade enclosures that rotate in azimuth
• Double elevation wheel and counterweights
• An electric drive for the azimuth wheels
• An actuated main reflector surface for gravity compensation
• A low-profile concrete foundation.

In addition, to provide precision blind pointing and focus corrections, the following technologies should be incorporated:

• Insulated and ventilated backup structure
• Thermal correction of pointing error and sub reflector focus error
• Wind-sensor correction of pointing error and sub reflector focus error
• A metrology-controlled sub reflector.


Transport System

Land transport is through high speed automated cars that takes people to places once a command is given.
The road ways are below the surface of the settlement

> Automated magnetic levitation trains run on both the ends and in the middle, the frequency is a train for every 5 min in peak hours and 10 min in off peak hours.

Transportation System

Inter galactic and earth transportation is through the vehicle using nano ion thruster engines. We also have high speed magnetic elevator system that connects the industrial complex with the settlement area.

Law and Order

The system is protected by two laws, one for the people and another one is for the robots.
The law for the people is the same as on earth. And the three laws that govern the robots are
1.	No robot should harm a human being.
2.	No robot should override its own commands.
3.	All robots should monitor their master’s health and moods and provide a solution. And should obey their masters.
The whole system is fully monitored and the law breakers are immediately caught and punished appropriately by efficient judicial bodies.


Industry

The central hub acts as the industrial complex. It houses all the production facilities. It is at a 0 gravity zone. Moving of large tools won’t be a problem. People are employed here and also at mining sites.


Evolution

> The system must evolve according to the growing population. The cylindrical tunnel which connects the central hub is made of a flexible material that can expand and contract like a hydraulic piston. When the time comes to accommodate more people in the settlement, the tunnel is shrunk, i.e. towards the central hub thus creating extra space to accommodate more people in it.



A Final Word:

In this paper, our best attempt has been to come up with a realistic project, based on the premise that it should build on existing and futuristic research and technology. In terms of methodology, we have presented ideas and options, and taken the reader through the analysis that lead us to decide on the final options for SHARP.
The resources for sharp will be completely from the moon as it contains all the material required for construction of the settlement. Also it would be using the waste scrap from the earth and the space debris. These new process creates a solution for clearing the space debris and the waste scrap from earth.
The position of this settlement is on the L4 of the langrarian points but first SHARP would be constructed on the L1 of the points and then transferred to L4.
This settlement has a diameter of 12000m and inner diameter of 2000m creating a large habitable space. The sphere has a diameter of 4000m where a large industry and research facility is built for its sustenance and further developments.  The central sphere has  0  gravity making it easier to work with the machines.
The system maintains gravity of 1g by rotation and gravity sync with earth and the moon. The resources for the construction of this settlement are taken from the moon. A temporary base is set up on the moon for the extraction.
We use only one source (lunar Regolith) for producing all the basic requirements of the settlement. We also use waste scrap and debris for the construction.
Water is produced using electrolysis and the agriculture is made through wired mesh technology. The power source is from the fusion reactors and the solar arrays.
The radiation levels are maintained inside the system. The external radiations are filtered with carbon nanotubes and grit blasted tungsten, using the layering concept.
All the people are governed by basic laws and the law breakers will be punished. Androids are used in the system to maintain and do some tedious tasks that is risky for the human being, such as working in mining sites or doing some repairs to the settlement from space.
To think that man could live in other places of the Universe, places that could be adapted to his needs can really become a challenge for our generation.

SHARP is designed to give its inhabitants a feel of life on Earth. Thus it would be apt in calling it                                 “A home away from home “.
